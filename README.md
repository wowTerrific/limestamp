# Limestamp

ðŸš§ In progress ðŸš§


### Important
First version will not account for Daylight Savings Time... This will be implemented in the future.

## TODO
- Parse offset
    - unit tests for helper functions
    - idomatic way to set the return message for all functions
- Start work on `limestamp()`
- Daylight Savings Time - may need to remove offset and do standard UTC all the way through to start...
